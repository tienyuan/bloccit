## Bloccit: a Reddit clone to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails 4.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io)

This project is hosted at [tienyuan-bloccit](http://tienyuan-bloccit.herokuapp.com/).

## Setup

Add environment variable information to /config/application.yml
This should consist of SendGrid username, SendGrid password and a Devise secret key.

Refer to /config/application.example.yml for an example.
